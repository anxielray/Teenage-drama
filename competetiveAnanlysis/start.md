# What is a competetive Analysis ?

- 

## What I am required to do!

- The task is to solve the problem of teenage school harrasment amongst teenagers.

- These are the school-based harrasment behaviours, characterized by the repeated use of violence, mockery amongst others.

- I am tasked to take an interview on the student body to understand them well.

- Run a competetive analysis from 10 organizations fiting school-harrasment from anywhere from global associations and local.

- Compare these 10 organizations' main actions, channels, values, according to the criteria you assume are relevant.

- I am required to submit a portable document that has the conclusions, a hart to show the competitive landscape, with 2 axes of your choice (digital, psychological, local, closeness to students, institutional, etc.) (PDF), and a competitive table to compare the organizations on 5 to 10 criteria (PDF).

## Step-to-step documentation to what will be done.

### 1. Research and Identify 10 Organizations/Associations.

- Select 10 organizations that are globally, regionally, or locally recognized for combating school harassment.

- I will choose a mix of NGOs, government programs, educational initiatives, or student-led organizations.

- Examples include:**

    - BullyingUK (United Kingdom)
    - StopBullying.gov (USA)
    - Ditch the Label (UK)
    - The Trevor Project (USA)
    - KiVa Program (Finland)
    - UNESCO (Global Anti-Bullying Initiative)
    - No Bullying (Australia)
    - Friends (Sweden)
    - CyberSmile Foundation (Global)
    - Kenya Institute for Bullying Prevention (Kenya) (fictional example for regional context)

### 2. Establish Relevant Criteria for Analysis

- Choose 5-10 criteria to evaluate and compare these organizations:**

- **Main Actions and Initiatives:** What strategies or programs do they use? (e.g., school workshops, online resources, counseling)
- **Communication Channels:** How do they reach their audience? (e.g., social media, school programs, websites)
- **Core Values and Principles:** What values guide their work? (e.g., inclusivity, youth empowerment)
- **Psychological Support:** Do they provide counseling or psychological support services?
- **Proximity and Reach:** Are they local, regional, or global? How close are they to students?
- **Institutional Partnerships:** Do they work with schools, governments, or NGOs?
- **Digital Presence:** How do they utilize digital tools (e.g., apps, online communities)?
- **Funding Sources:** What are their primary sources of funding?
- **Impact and Outcomes:** Have they published any data or success stories about their impact?
- **Engagement with Students:**** How actively do they involve students in initiatives?

### 3. Conduct Competitive Analysis and Document Findings

- **Introduction (1-2 pages):** Provide an overview of the purpose and objectives of the analysis.
Summarize your main conclusions about the competitive landscape.

- **Example Summary Conclusion:**
“Our analysis highlights that while many organizations offer broad anti-bullying resources, few focus specifically on close engagement with teens aged 15-18.
Personalized digital tools are underutilized compared to in-person support.”

- **Competitive Report (PDF):**
Detail each organization's activities, strengths, weaknesses, and areas of uniqueness.
Organize findings clearly.

- **Chart to Illustrate Competitive Landscape (PDF):**

- Create a chart with two axes of your choice. For example:
            - X-Axis: Closeness to Students (Low → High)
            - Y-Axis: Digital Presence (Weak → Strong)
	    - Plot each organization accordingly.

- **Competitive Table (PDF):**

- Create a table comparing the organizations based on the selected criteria.
- Ensure it’s formatted for easy comparison (e.g., side-by-side columns).

### Take Aways.

- **Be User-Centric:**
Remember that the ultimate goal is to understand teenagers better.
Conclusions should reflect actionable insights to improve their holiday experiences.
- **Clarity and Simplicity:** Focus on presenting data clearly and concisely.

- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent formatting, naming conventions, and design elements throughout the deliverables.
