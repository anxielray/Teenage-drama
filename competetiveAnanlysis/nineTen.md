# 2. Childline.

- This information captures a comprehensive overview of Childline Kenya's mission, history, and services. It highlights how Childline Kenya was founded to address key gaps in child protection, such as limited comprehensive services and inadequate coordination among service providers.

- Their efforts to establish a toll-free helpline in 2006 and transition to a three-digit number, 116, in 2008 reflect a commitment to providing easy and free access for children to report abuse or seek support. 

- The helpline serves as a crucial resource for counseling, protection services, and effective referrals, ensuring children can voice concerns and receive assistance in a timely manner. It also serves as a channel for the public to report cases on behalf of children.

- This work aligns with Childline Kenya's vision of creating an environment where children's voices are heard and their needs are met through collaborative action among stakeholders and service providers.
