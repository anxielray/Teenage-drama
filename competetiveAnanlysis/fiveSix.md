# This document will contain the insigts from the third 2 Associations.


- The Associations are `KiVa Project` from the Finland and `UNESCO` from the (Global Anti-Bullying Initiative):

## 1. KiVa Project.

- Kiva is a non-profit organization with the mission of expanding financial access to underserved communities, thereby fostering growth and opportunities. Operating through microfinance institutions, social impact businesses, schools, and other entities, Kiva facilitates the distribution of small loans to entrepreneurs, particularly those in developing regions.

## Impact Assessment.

- **Reach and Scale:** Since its inception in 2005, Kiva has facilitated over 1.6 million loans, totaling more than`$1.68 billion`. This extensive reach demonstrates Kiva's capacity to engage global lenders and provide essential capital to millions of borrowers. It is supported by a network of over 300 partners worldwide.

- **Key Metrics:** Kiva boasts a repayment rate of 96.3%, indicating a highly successful loan repayment system. With an average loan size of around $411, it focuses on delivering manageable and impactful loans to micro-entrepreneurs and other borrowers.

##  Lending Model and Process

- Kiva's lending process involves collaboration with Field Partners who identify and vet borrowers. This decentralized model allows Kiva to work in diverse regions and sectors. Key points of the process include:

    - Borrower profiles are uploaded to the Kiva website by Field Partners.
    - Lenders choose which borrowers to fund, often in increments of $25.
    - The funds are transferred to the Field Partners, who in turn disburse the loans to the borrowers.
    - Borrowers repay their loans through Field Partners, and the funds are returned to the original lenders, who can then choose to re-lend or withdraw their funds.

## Financing and Revenue Model

- **Funding Sources:** Kiva relies on grants, loans, and donations from various users, corporations, and institutions. Major donors and supporters have included organizations like Chevron Corporation, Visa Inc., and Skoll Foundation.

- **Sustainability:** Kiva's model is sustained by fees charged to Field Partners and donations from users, rather than interest earned on loans themselves. Kiva operates primarily on donations and does not charge borrowers directly.

## Social Impact and Criticisms

- **Women Empowerment:** Kiva has a significant focus on female-owned businesses, with 81% of loans going to women. This emphasis reflects the organization's belief in the transformative impact of empowering women through financial inclusion.

- **Field Partners and Interest Rates:** There is criticism regarding the interest rates charged by Kiva's Field Partners, which can sometimes be perceived as high, especially in developing countries. While Kiva defends these rates as necessary to cover administrative costs and market risks, the debate highlights a tension between providing access to capital and ensuring fair and ethical lending practices.

- **Effectiveness:** Despite Kiva’s size and global influence, organizations like GiveWell have raised concerns about the measurable impact of microfinance on poverty alleviation. Some partners have been noted to charge high interest rates or have high drop-out rates among recipients.

## Innovations and Special Initiatives

- Kiva has demonstrated adaptability and a willingness to innovate, with initiatives including:

    - **Green Loans:** Supporting borrowers to adopt environmentally-friendly practices and technologies such as solar panels and high-efficiency stoves.
    - **Kiva U.S.:** A peer-to-peer lending program offering 0% interest loans to U.S. entrepreneurs who may be ineligible for traditional financing.
    - **Kiva Labs and Kiva City:** Efforts to improve flexibility, address local challenges, and boost lending within specific communities.

## Challenges and Areas for Improvement

- **High Field Partner Interest Rates:** While Kiva does not charge interest directly, its Field Partners do, often at rates comparable to or slightly below commercial lending rates. This has led to criticism that microloans may be financially burdensome despite their good intentions.

- **Transparency:** Providing more granular details on interest rates and costs for each loan and Field Partner would improve Kiva's transparency, fostering more trust and engagement among potential lenders.

- **Sustainability Concerns:** The long-term impact and effectiveness of microloans as a tool for poverty alleviation are debated. Greater focus on monitoring, reporting, and evaluating social impact can help address these concerns.

## Summary and Conclusion

- Kiva has made significant strides in expanding financial inclusion and supporting underserved communities through microloans. By leveraging a network of Field Partners, the organization helps bring capital to regions where traditional financial institutions may be limited or inaccessible. Despite some criticisms regarding interest rates and the tangible impact of microloans, Kiva’s efforts to innovate and create diverse programs highlight its commitment to driving meaningful change. Moving forward, focusing on enhanced transparency, social impact measurement, and more inclusive practices will be key to furthering its mission.
